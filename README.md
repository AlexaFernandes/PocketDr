Project for the TAMa course at BUT FIT.
It consists of an android mobile application used for the management and caretaking of people who cannot do that by themselves. The account can be of a caretaker or a dependant. Caretakers manage the accounts of their dependants, creating the medicine reminders for them and their own. Then receiving notifications and being able to mark the medicine that has already been taken.

It makes use of Firebase Realtime and Firestore databases to save data and update what is displayed on the application.
